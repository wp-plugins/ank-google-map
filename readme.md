## FAQ

**Why did u call it Light Weight ?**

Because it does not depend on jQuery, written in pure Java Script.
Options page utilize inbuilt jQuery and Color Picker.
It uses WP dash-icons in Plugin Options Page.
It uses WP text editor on Plugin Options Page.
It does not create additional tables in your database, uses inbuilt 'wp_options' table.
The whole package is about 60 kb. (~15 kb zipped).

**What do you mean by Non Bloated**

There are many of Map plugins in plugin directory, but most of them not written well.
Means they put lots of java script (uncompressed) code on every page of your website.

It does not depends on external js library like: jQuery.

Each time you save map settings , this plugin write processed js code to 'agm-user-js.js' file.
There may be some chance that plugin unable to create/write this file.This file is essential and map won't work without this file.

######Possible reason are :

* Not enough permission to write a file.
* Plugin malfunction (my fault).
* You hosting provider has disabled File Handling Function via php.ini (rare).
 
######How to resolve :

* Login to your website via your FTP client software. (eg: FileZilla)
  and change file permission of plugins folder.
